# Portfolio

##Description

The purpose of this application is to have somewhere to store all of my work as I move through this coding bootcamp, as well as have a place to show future employers my past work. In doing this I also made this application responsive in that when you change the viewport from a pc to a moblile device, the page elements should respond accordingly. I was able to make the webpage responsive by using the flex display property and by using mediaqueryies to change the layout and size based on the viewport of the device.What I learned during this project was: media queries, flexbox and its properties (flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, align-items, justify-content, flex-start, etc), how to set an image as an anchor, being more organized when ordering and naming htm,l and css styling elements, and using a reset css style sheet

## Features

The main feature of this application is that when the width goes below 949px, the layout changes so that [users who want to view this page from a mobile device are able to see the elements of the page in an mobile friendly layout. Other features include anchor tags in the header work section, and contact me section. When interacted with the anchor elements in the header you will jump to the corresponding section. The anchor tags in the work section take you to the deployed page for that project. Finally the anchor tag in the coming soon section and contact me section will take you to my GitHub page with all of my repositories.
