# React-Portfolio

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a a single-page web application using React. This way I, as a developer, can practice using React as well as create an application to use as my portfolio. This way I can show future employers what I have worked on.

During this project I learned: 
- how to install and React as a way to create single-page web applications
- how to implement JSX expressions in order to have JavaScript functionality in my application
- how to use props as arguments for functions in React tht are define in one fie, but can be used in others
- the concempt of compnenets and how they function as part of the single-page application that can be rendered at different times without changing the page
- how to set up and implement useState in react
